"67296273","1","","","2021-04-28 08:09:12","","0","24","<p>I can't seem to find a way to set the nested properties of my state.</p>
<pre><code>// state
{
  name,
  info: {
    foo
    email
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>My state has multiple properties, info is an object with properties as well.
I would like to add or update a property of info. I suppose I could do a <code>get('info')</code> and do <code>{...info ...newProp}</code> before setting info back to the state. But, that would cost a <code>get()</code> call.</p>
<p>Is there a way to update info properties with a set ? <code>state.set('info.foo', 'bar')</code></p>
